# ThreeBody
Here, we analyze the Luminosity Time Series Data from the Kepler Space Probe in order to identify Stable Three-Body Systems, as part of an IRP at NUS High School.

## Detecting Stable Three-Body Systems
Team: Ernest, Vikram

Mentor: Dr Bernard Ricardo

To be done in Year 4/5 - still up in the air

Starts on: **12 May 2021**

Prannaya's Schedule:
1. Retrieve Kepler Dataset by 14 May
2. Find Possible Fluctuations in data by 26 May
3. Send the findings to Vikram by 27 May

Vikram's Schedule:
1. Add on to this list

**My work**: get the data, clean up the data, and figure out what possible patterns we are looking for
(essentially data preprocessing)
