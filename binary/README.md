# Identifying Falsely Classified Binary Star Candidates


## Background

As we well know, the HS Hydrae were originally classified as Planetary candidates, yet later we did discover them to be a trinary star system. In accordance with [Orosz et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07295), it has been conjectured that about 15-20% of Binary Stars discovered and recorded are likely to be misclassified trinary star systems, and since light curves of some configuration, especially Figure 8, seem to be simply identical to the light curve of a binary star, this makes it a lot harder to identify which is a trinary star system and which is binary.
