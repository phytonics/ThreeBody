# Lagrange-5 Point Configuration Analysis

There are two possible L5 configurations that are prominently considered:

1. Two small bodies orbiting around a massive body, wherein the smaller bodies exert a negligible gravitational force.
2. One small body orbiting with a massive binary star configuration.

Anyways, I don't have a choice so um... I really don't know what to do.
