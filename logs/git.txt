-^LAbstract
-
-During the last decade, the transit method has evolved to one of the most promising techniques in
-the search for extrasolar planets and the quest to ﬁnd other earth-like worlds. In theory, the transit
-method is straight forward being based on the detection of an apparent dimming of the host star’s
-light due to an orbiting planet traversing in front of the observer. However, in practice, the detection
-of such light curve dips and their conﬁdent ascription to a planetary transit is heavily burdened by the
-presence of diﬀerent sources of noise, the most prominent of which is probably the so called intrinsic
-stellar variability. Filtering out potential transit signals from background noise requires a well adjusted
-high-pass ﬁlter. In order to optimize such a ﬁlter, i.e. to achieve best separation between signal and
-noise, one typically requires access to benchmark datasets that exhibit the same light curve with
-and without obstructing noise. Several methods for simulating stellar variability have been proposed
-for the construction of such benchmark datasets. However, while such methods have been widely
-used in testing transit method detection algorithms in the past, it is not very well known how such
-simulations compare to real recorded light curves - a fact that might be contributed to the lack of large
-databases of stellar light curves for comparisons at that time. With the increasing amount of light
-curve data now available due to missions such as Kepler, I have here undertaken such a comparison
-of synthetic and real light curves for one particular method that simulates stellar variability based on
-scaled power spectra of the Sun’s ﬂux variations. Conducting the respective comparison also in terms
-of estimated power spectra of real and simulated light curves, I have revealed that the two datasets
-exhibit substantial diﬀerences in average power, with the synthetic power spectra having generally a
